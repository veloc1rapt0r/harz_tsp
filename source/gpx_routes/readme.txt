here in the folder we save the gpx files for the routes. 
HWN110_HWN111.gpx is the file created by komoot and it works super with all the information we need.
tour_1_3.gpx is the file created by me and it is not working for now. I just append 2 waypoints to the file. 
    Maybe I need to calulate the route or give the waypoints to komoot to do the calulation.
Need to test it more.
