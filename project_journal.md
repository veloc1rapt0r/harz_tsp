Was already made:
Downloaded the gpx data from the HWN website.
Parse the gpx to get all Waypoints, saved them to excel
For the first calculation computed the direct distance between the waypoints.

04.01.25
I created a new account on komoot and added 2 tracks. I can only download the tracks from bought regions.
Tracks from komoot are working fine. I can download them and use them in the project.
I can get distance, time, elevation and other information from the tracks.
I tyred to create a track by myself and it is not working. I added waypoints to the track as start-end but the file has wrong format.
The idea is to get the waypoints from the HWN gpx file, give them to komoot, calculate the route and download the track. 
Also with the package that download the tracks from komoot I get authentication errors. I need to fix this.
